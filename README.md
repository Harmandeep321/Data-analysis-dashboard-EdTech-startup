## The Challenge: Finding Growth in the Data

### Situation

An EdTech startup wanted to strategically expand its library of recorded courses. While they had a vast collection of course metadata, they lacked a unified view to answer critical questions about learner behavior, content popularity, and market demand. My role was to transform this raw data into actionable insights.

### Task

The objective was to create an interactive dashboard that would provide clear, data-driven answers to a series of key business questions, with a specific focus on **category-level analysis**. The client needed to:

  * Understand the **distribution of courses** by type, category, and subcategory.
  * Measure **viewer engagement** by calculating average views per category, subcategory, and language.
  * Identify the most **in-demand skills** within each category.
  * Map out the **distribution of languages** and viewer preferences.
  * Explore how **subtitles and course duration** impact viewership.
  * Pinpoint **top-rated instructors** to guide partnership opportunities.
  * Investigate the correlation between **skill variety** and course viewership.

### Action

  * **Data Preparation:** I used Power Query to clean and structure the raw dataset, handling inconsistencies and preparing it for analysis.
  * **Data Modeling:** Built a logical data model with defined relationships to enable complex cross-table analysis.
  * **Insightful Visualizations:** I developed a suite of dynamic visualizations tailored to each business question. This included charts for course distribution, average views, language insights, and a static view of top instructors.
  * **DAX Mastery:** Created custom DAX measures to calculate key metrics like average views, and to handle conditional logic for complex scenarios (e.g., course duration calculations).

### Result

The final product is a professional Power BI dashboard that equips the EdTech startup with a clear roadmap for growth. It provides:

  * **Strategic guidance** for content development and curriculum planning.
  * **Actionable insights** for identifying high-performing content and instructors.
  * **Data-backed confidence** to launch courses in new categories, languages, and formats.
