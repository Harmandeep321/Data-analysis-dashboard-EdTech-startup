## 🌟 The Story Behind the Dashboard (STAR Method)

### 🟡 **Situation**

An ambitious EdTech startup, rich in recorded course content, faced a challenge: understanding how their courses performed and what learners truly wanted. They lacked a centralized view to leverage this valuable metadata for strategic growth.

### 🟢 **Task**

Our mission: to create an interactive dashboard that would:

  - Clearly visualize course distribution across categories and formats.
  - Reveal viewer preferences based on language and content type.
  - Identify trending skills and highlight underserved content areas.
  - Provide stakeholders with a solid foundation for data-driven content decisions.

### 🔵 **Action**

  - **Power Query for Data Transformation:** Meticulously cleaned and preprocessed the raw course data.
  - **Robust Data Modeling:** Built efficient data models, establishing key relationships between course attributes.
  - **Intuitive Visualizations Crafted:** Developed compelling charts for:
      - Course category & subcategory breakdown
      - Comparative analysis of course types (recorded, hybrid, etc.)
      - Average views by various segments (category, subcategory, language)
      - Extraction and ranking of the most common skills per category
      - Detailed language-wise course distribution
  - **Enhanced Interactivity:** Integrated slicers and informative tooltips for dynamic exploration.

### 🟣 **Result**

A dynamic Power BI dashboard was delivered, providing:

  - **High-level strategic insights** guiding future content development.
  - **Clear identification of viewer interests** and top-performing content segments.
  - **Actionable, data-backed guidance** for targeting new course areas and expanding language offerings.
